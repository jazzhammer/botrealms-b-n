# introduction
this is a companion software project for robotics classes i teach at the salmon arm makerspace:

https://www.innovatesa.ca/makerspace/

# philosopy
built in node, this project will evolve from use of raw javascript to use of convenient 
frameworks such as express and nestjs.  the evolutionary steps will be maintained because each 
step has instructional value. eg. it's worthwhile to know what express and nestjs are doing behind 
the scenes. 

# functionality
there are many facets of robotics are represented in this backend component.  robotics is a broad 
endeavor that requires master of conceptualization, design, prototyping, manufacture, and management. 
this software, in cooperation with its matching front end ( repo: botrealms-f-r ) provides support
for webapplication features such as cataloguing of concepts and designs, prototyping resources, and 
automation of manufacture & management, such as mechanical build instructions for assembly lines and 
IoT monitoring and control.
